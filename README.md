2nd homework to Research Software  

## Ancient encryption systems

> Ancient cyphers are no longer used, except for educational purposes, because they are
> to simple to crack using computers.  
> The first 2 funcions in this package are related to **Caesar cypher** and were named afther its
> creator **Julius Caesar**. This type of encryption was used by the Roman emperor to send
> confidential messages to his generals.  
>
> The goal of this project is to help us undertand how **Caesar cypher** works and let us 
> encrypt and decript text messages using a key.

## How to use the software

> The executable is far simple to use: just asks for a string of text and a key to encrypt it.
> Then it produces the encripted text and asks for a new key to decrypt it.  
> If we enter the wrong key to decrypt, the resulting message is still encrypted.

## Functions in the code

> CaesarEncryption()  
> CaesarDecryption()
